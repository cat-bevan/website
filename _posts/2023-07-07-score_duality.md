# *Duality*

Written over the course of 5 months during the first year of my MMus in Composition, *Duality* represents an experiment in musical dualities, featuring two fully developed and 'opposite' musical ideas and their respective synthesis into one complete whole. In the piece's third section, originally antagonistic dynamics like syncronous vs. asyncronous, predictable vs. unpredictable, divisions of 2 vs. divisions of 3, are morphed into mutually codependent relationships of syncronous yet asyncronous, predictable yet unpredictable, divisions of 2 yet 3, and so forth.      

## Performance information

Performed April 2019 by the Edmonton Saxophone Quartet, Convocation Hall, University of Alberta
