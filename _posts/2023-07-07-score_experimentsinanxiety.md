# *Experiments in Anxiety*

Written as an assignment in my 3rd year Undergrad composition course, *Experiments in Anxiety* marked my first foray into atonal-adjacent composition. Mimicking the form of a classical sonatina, being keyless means that the C section is not B in the key of A, but rather B in the rhythmic make-up of A. 

## Performance information

Performed by the Land's End Ensemble in April 2017 as part of their 14th Annual National Composer Competition. Placed 2nd and received the audience favourite award.
