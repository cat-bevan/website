# *To the Ends of the Earth*

Comprised of both prose and notation working in tandem, *To the Ends of the Earth* is an improvisatory meditation for a piano soloist. The performer has a great deal of control over the details of the work - rhythm, dynamics, even pitch and form to an extent - while the macro-level structure of the work is set in three pages of specified order and the prose helps get the soloist in a particular 'headspace' for the improvisation. 

## Performance information
